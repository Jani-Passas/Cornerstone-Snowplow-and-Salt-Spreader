# Cornerstone-Snowplow-and-Salt-Spreader
This repository has both the python code (for the UI) and the arduino code (to move the robot) for the final project in the Cornerstone Engineering class. The project's purpose was to develop a robotic's focused solution to common problems, and our solution was to create a remote controlled snow plow to help elderly or people with less motor control to clear their walkways/driveways to prevent them from being trapped in their homes. The software team consisted of me (Jani Passas) and Dani McLaughlin, and the mechanical designs were made by Nikitas Constantinitas and Julianne Hyvert.
